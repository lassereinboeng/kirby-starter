# Kirby Starter

My personal starting point for building websites with the flat file CMS Kirby on top of Vite, Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
2. `composer install`
3. `pnpm install` (or `npm install` if you prefer slow things)
4. `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`) for a local development server
5. Head to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

Have fun!
